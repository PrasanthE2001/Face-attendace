# Face Recognition Attendance System

This project implements a Face Recognition Attendance System using Flask, OpenCV, and DeepFace. The system captures student images via a webcam, verifies their identity against pre-stored face images, and marks their attendance based on face recognition.

### Features

- **Real-time Face Recognition**: Uses webcam input to capture and verify student faces.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Records attendance in a CSV file.
- **Location Verification**: Ensures students are within a designated area before marking attendance.
- **Image Upload**: Allows for uploading student face images for initial setup.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple HTML interface for interactions.

### Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web framework for Python to handle web requests and serve content.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing and computer vision.
- **DeepFace**: Python library for face recognition and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For handling attendance records in CSV format.
- **Geopy**: For location verification based on GPS coordinates.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Face-Recognition-Attendance-System.git
   cd Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended) using bash #Command prompt:

**python -m venv venv
**source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Required Packages using bash #Command prompt:

**pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set Up Directories: Ensure that you have the following directory structure:

Face-Recognition-Attendance-System/
├── face/                # Directory to store student face images
├── CapturedImage/       # Directory to store captured images
├── attendance.csv       # Attendance records
├── app.py               # Main application file
├── static/              # Static files (CSS, JS)
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
└── templates/           # HTML templates
    └── index.html

- **face/: Directory where student face images are stored.
- **CapturedImage/: Directory to store the captured images for attendance marking.
- **attendance.csv: CSV file that logs attendance with student names and timestamps.
- **app.py: The main application script where Flask server is defined.
- **static/: Contains static files such as stylesheets and JavaScript files.
- **templates/: Contains HTML files for rendering the user interface.


5. Ensure You Have a Webcam: This system uses a webcam for capturing student images.

### USAGE:

1. Run the Application in command prompt:
    python app.py

2. Access the Application: Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

3. Upload Student Images: Use the provided input field to upload student face images.

4. Capture and Verify: Click the "Capture and Verify" button to start the webcam, capture an image, and verify the student's identity.

5. Shutdown: To stop the camera and release resources, use the "Shutdown Camera" button.
